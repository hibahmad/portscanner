<h2>Python Port Scanner Script</h2> 

<h6>In this project, I created a Python script which acts as a port scanner. With both functions working together, a TCP connection attempt is made to the specified port (using two arguments: an IP address and a list of ports). Then, the script will look for a response (TCP SYN-ACK) from the server.</h6>
