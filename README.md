<h2>Python Port Scanner Project</h2> 

<h6>In this project, I created a port scanner using Python. Using two functions (one which makes the connection attempt, and one which performs DNS lookup), a TCP connection attempt is made to the specified port (using two arguments: an IP address and a list of ports). Then, the script will look for a response (TCP SYN-ACK) from the server and print the result.</h6>
